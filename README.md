 **Dataset:
 **
The dataset is created using a GPT model and identified from Kaggle. To achieve our goal, we can create the dataset based on the features by integrating two different datasets into one.

1.  Customer Details: Includes Customer Name, Email, Date & Time, Server Name, Server Employee ID, Age, and Preferences (Dining, Room Preferences, Sports, Wellness, Pricing Patterns).
      o   Generated using ChatGPT.
2.  Feedback Data:
      o   Source: Kaggle (TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews).

 Integrated both datasets into a single one and named as ** Final dataset** for project implementation.
